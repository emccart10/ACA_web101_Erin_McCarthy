                                            <p>Old, grumpy cat, that suffers from high blood pressure. Has experience with years of mouse and bird hunting. Firmiliar with different systems of laying around, spitting out food, coughing up hairballs. Generally likeable, except when grumpy. Hundreds of cat lives of experience with laying on computers. Quick learner.</p>
                                            <p> I strive in a warm, fuzzy environment with lots of boxes and snacks. Will lay around for food, will walk for food, and will cry for food but struggle with the idea of working for food. Negotiable depending on food type.</p>
                                            <p> In my future position, I'm interested in continuing to manage the day to day activities of humans. I feel that with my years of experience, I have learned how to successfully control their behavior and keep them on their toes. They should never think that there is a pattern to what I am doing.</p>
